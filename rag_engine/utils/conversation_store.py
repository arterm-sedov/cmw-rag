    """Salt session_id with chat history to isolate memory per chat.

    When Gradio's save_history=True is enabled, different chats share the same
    session_hash. Salting ensures each chat (new or loaded from history) gets
    its own isolated session memory.

    Strategy: Generate deterministically from the first user message.
    - For new chats: uses current_message (first message being sent)
    - For loaded chats: uses first user message from history
    - For continuing same chat: same first message → same salt → same session_id → memory preserved

    This approach is robust because:
    1. The first message is stable across Gradio's save/load cycle
    2. Each distinct chat has a different first message → different session_id
    3. Same chat always generates the same session_id → memory continuity

    Args:
        base_session_id: Base session hash from Gradio request
        history: Current chat history from Gradio (includes loaded chats)
        current_message: Current message being sent (used for new chats)

    Returns:
        Salted session_id or None if base_session_id is None

    Example:
        >>> from rag_engine.utils.conversation_store import salt_session_id
        >>> session_id = salt_session_id("abc123", [], "Hello")
        >>> session_id is not None
