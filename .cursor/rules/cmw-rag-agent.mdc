- Before any coding gather information:
    - search internet for reference documentation on the frameworks and libraries to use
    - then go to the official documentation sources you found and digest the best practices
    - do not read just a page or to, scan the docs and links and doc hierarchy
    - gather all the information to base your actions on ground truth
- PLAN your course of action after gathering the reference info.
- Code style: langchain-pure, super dry, super lean, abstract, modular, pythonic, super smart, modular, linted, deduplicated, pydantic, pythonic
- Always run linter after making any changes:
    - Use Ruff as the primary linter: `ruff check <file_path>` for specific files
    - Run Ruff before committing: `ruff check <file_path>` for changed files only
    - Be critical about Ruff reports, implement only the necessary changes
    - Only lint the files that were modified, not the entire codebase
    - Configuration in pyproject.toml follows LangChain and Gradio best practices
- Ensure testability and extensibility.
- When refactoring code, change only the levant parts.
- Ensure LangChain purity.
- Follow LangChain's best practices, patterns, and conventions:

- Group and isolate code based on its function in different files to avoid clutter.
- Do not duplicate code, encapsulate any reused code in methods/functions.
- Never break existing code.
- Do not delete logging, but update it.
- Do not delete comments, rather update them.
- Produce flawless code.
- Reanalyze your changes twice for any issues you might have introduced.
- Place imports always on top.
- Use environment variables for secrets.
- Put reports to a relevant `docs/**/progress_reports/` folder under `/docs/` or its relevant `cwd/subfolder`
- Put tests to `/agent_ng/_tests` preferably, or under a relevant `cwd/_tests` where the files are modified or created, otherwise to `@/.misc_files`
