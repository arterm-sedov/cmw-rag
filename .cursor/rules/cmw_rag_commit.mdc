description: Apply this rule to git commit messages.
---

This rule applies to git commit messages in the version control pane and in the terminal.

Generate the commit message text, but do no add files, stage or push the commit.

## Commit Message Requirements

- The message must be concise, structured, and strictly relevant to the changes in the commit.
- Keep the length to the necessary minimum. Avoid blabber.
